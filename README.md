The **Diet Assist App** is an AI-powered tool designed to help users make informed dietary decisions. The app allows users to upload an image of food, detects whether it contains a specific type of food, and provides a health recommendation based on the user‚Äôs dietary goals.

- **Food Detection**: The app detects whether the uploaded image contains food.
- **Food Classification**: Identifies the specific type of food in the image.
- **Health Recommendations**: Offers advice on whether to eat the detected food based on health goals.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the recommendation to speech and plays the audio within the app.
